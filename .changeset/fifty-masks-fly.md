This is a breaking change because the NestJS app now uses the latest version of NestJS and the Nextjs app now uses the latest version of Nextjs.

The changes were made because the latest versions of NestJS and Nextjs have some nice features that we want to add. There were also some issues with the previous versions that we wanted to fix.
